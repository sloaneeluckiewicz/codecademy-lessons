-Selections are array-like data structures that include a reference to the elements with D3 methods and their hierarchy in the DOM. You can create a selection with .selectAll() or a single-item selection with .select()

-The .data(), .enter() and .append() methods all work in unison to create elements and associate their corresponding data with the existing DOM

-The d parameter inside functions used in a D3 context represents the datum associated with the element at hand

-The .attr() and .style() methods allow you to customize the appearance of each element based on data.

-The .on() method can bind an event listener on the elements in the selection.
