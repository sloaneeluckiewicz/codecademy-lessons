1. loops perform repetitive actions so we don't have to code that process manually every time.
2. for loops are written with an iterator variable that increments or decrements
3. a nested for loop is a loop inside another loop 
4. while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions
5. stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops
6. do... while loops run code at least once - only checking the stopping condition after the first execution 
7. the break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block
