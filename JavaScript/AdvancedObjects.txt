Advanced Objects:
- The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object
- the this keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object
- methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object
- the value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from 
- we cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties 
- JS objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.
- the usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed. 
- setter and getter methods allow for more detailed wasys of accessing and assigning properties 
- factory fuctions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly 
- there are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.
